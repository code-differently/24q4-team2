## numMeCrazy Game Project

### Our App
The numMeCrazy Game is an exciting and interactive project where players can enjoy a simple number-guessing game in either solo or dual mode. By following the project plan and adhering to best practices in design and development, we aim to deliver an engaging, functional, and well-documented game experience. The combination of randomness, difficulty scaling, and AI interaction makes it a fun challenge for players to test their number-guessing skills.
